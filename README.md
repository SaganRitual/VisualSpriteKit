Developer tool/toy for experimentation with Apple Swift's SpriteKit

# Installation

* Clone.
* Checkout the `dev` branch.
* Build the `Lorentz` project.

# Usage

Tap to place a sprite. Tap the blue ring on the sprite to bring up a menu of options.
So far the only working ones are move, rotate, and scale. Move by dragging the center, rotate by
single-finger dragging within the selection indicator. Scale with pinch/unpinch. Tap the sprite
again to dismiss the selection indicator. More to come
